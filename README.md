An ontological analysis between Artificial Intelligence and Human Intelligence.

Artificial Intelligence is impacting the world with its development and potential. However, misperceptions guide the question when comparing technological capabilities and human capabilities. And these misperceptions become clearer under ontological analysis.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Human Intelligence (HI) have similarities in the transmission of information mentioned by (Fan et al, 2022) "Neural Network is a model that resembles a biological neural network in its process of transporting the information. Neural Network is just a structure based on algorithmic mathematics." In artificial intelligence, this process occurs by storing and transmitting electrical micro-inputs converted into machine code. In human intelligence - neurons stock and transit the information across the synapse.

The processes described above in both areas are known as Neural Networks. Therefore, we need to understand human intelligence capacity only in this area and not in its general aspect because we could consider three types of Artificial intelligence as mentioned in a study by (Terblanche & Nicky, at, 2022) "There are three types of AI: Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)." Ergo, the structure to be compared is logical and probabilistic. The Logic operates on True and False sentences; Probability is right and wrong.

The difference between AI and HI occurs in this process. For Artificial Intelligence, Logic and Probability are just electrical impulses. Human Intelligence is the apprehension of reality. Therefore, for Artificial Intelligence, there is only the quantitative aspect seen in an article published by (Wang & Ma, 2022) "The Neural Network does not process contextual data between objects in an image, and this prevents it from answering relational reasoning questions." But for Human Intelligence, there is the quantitative and the qualitative.

Therefore, even seeking to equate Artificial Intelligence and Human Intelligence, the substantial difference occurs through the process of apprehension of reality.
